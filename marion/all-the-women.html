        <p class="introduction">
            To explore challenges that women face to find their own voice, especially when they come from a catholic upbringing, I created five fictional sisters. In "<i>All the women you have in yourselves</i>", I perform songs that talk about their emancipation.

        <p class="poem"><i>Gaëlle</i>
<br>
        <br>I knew I quickly had to choose
        <br>Between a man and religion
        <br>Mum was encouraging the first option
        <br>So this is what I did
        <br>I got married to the one she agreed
        <br>It was fun for a while (while)
<br>
        <br>I knew I had to make children
        <br>It all seemed very natural
        <br>What else a woman could wish for ?
        <br>All that I hold dear is
        <br>A heritage that was passed down to me
        <br>It was fun for a while (while)
<br>
        <br>I knew time was coming
        <br>It wouldn’t be enough anymore
<br>
        <br>I knew I’d have to face it all
        <br>The boredom, the front door
        <br>But what should I even fight for ?
        <br>So I convince myself
        <br>That ardent life is for someone else
        <br>And I forget for a while
        <br>Just for a while
        </p>
<br>

        <p class="poem"><i>Anne</i>
<br>
        <br>When I was a kid
        <br>nothing mattered
        <br>easy easy life
        <br>I miss rules to the game
<br>
        <br>Maybe life’s not easy
        <br>but I crave
        <br>I crave for perfection
<br>
        <br>It wakes me up every morning
        <br>the fear of never being enough
        <br>if I was on a battlefield
        <br>I would be laying on the ground
<br>
        <br>Fallen from up high
        <br>wildly aware
        <br>I wish I knew
        <br>how to let it go
<br>
        <br>Maybe life’s not easy
        <br>but I crave
        <br>I crave for happiness
<br>
        <br>It keeps me up every night
        <br>the desire of being seen
        <br>for who I truly am
        <br>cause I am still wandering
        </p>
